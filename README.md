# My solutions to the Buzzard course exercises

This repository contains my attemps to complete the exercises from Kevin Buzzard's _Formalizing Mathematics 2024_ course on Lean 4.

I have not attended the course personally but I attended a Lean 4 course in my University and I was recommended to continue practicing by completing the exercises form Buzzar's course.

At the end of each section I want to add a few other results I think are related and interesting.
